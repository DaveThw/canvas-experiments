 <h1>Canvas Development #10</h1>
 <p>Double-click anywhere in the square to draw a circle!</p>
 <div style="float: left; height: 320px; width: 315px; overflow: auto;">
  <!-- use "overflow: scroll;" to make scroll bars always visible -->
  <!-- It looks like, in Chrome on my Chromebook, the width of the parent div needs to be at least 15px greater than the canvas, and the height at least 20px greater, for the scroll bars to deactivate -->
  <canvas id="myCanvas" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
 </div>
 <p>Total number of items: <span id="totalCount">-1</span><br />
    Next unique item id: <span id="nextId">-1</span><br />
    This item id: <span id="thisId">-1</span><br />
    Number of items in this group: <span id="groupCount">-1</span><br />
    Number of items in current selection: <span id="selectionCount">-1</span><br />
    Click on a circle to select it, shift-click to add to your selection, or control-click to toggle selection.<br />
    Press backsapce/delete to delete selected circles!<br />
    (note: if nothing is selected, then backspace will do it's default action, which is to go to the previous page in your browser's history...)<br />
    (also note: the canvas needs to have the input focus (shown by a blue halo) to catch any keyboard events)<br />
    Ctrl-A will select all circles.<br />
    Double-clicking now supported - double click to create a circle, and double-click on a circle to select only it!<br />
    Finally!.. Added the ability to move a circle - or a selection of multiple circles! :-)<br />
    You can group multiple object together by selecting them and pressing Ctrl-G (they will retain their relative stacking order, but the new group will be placed at the top of the current stack)<bṛ />
    Double-click on a Group to 'enter' it - everything else will go transparent, and you'll be able to move the items within the group around - Press Esc to exit the group<br />
    Select one (or more) groups and press Ctrl-U to un-group them (they will retain their relative stacking order, but the newy un-group items will be placed at the top of the current stack)
